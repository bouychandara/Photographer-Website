          <p>A photographer isÂ a person who captures and creates images using a camera. Photography is both a science and an art, requiring technical skill and artistic vision. Photographers use their knowledge of light, composition, and perspective to create images that convey emotions, tell stories, or simply capture moments in time.</p>
